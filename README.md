### Goals for this Project

#### I would like to expand on this generator by adding more prompts to further decrease the amount of content the user has to type. For example, I would like to include a prompt for the user to enter image urls for screenshots or video demos of their apps

### Languages and Tools Used

#### The application was built using JavaScript, specifically Node.js. I also used the Github API to obtain user profile picture, user emails and blogs as backup if no email is listed.
